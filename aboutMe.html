  <h1> Who is Atiksh?</h1>
  <h2> You must be wondering who is the designer of this portfolio? Well it is me Atiksh Sunil Mutalik. I had started
    coding when I was 12 years old and I am born on November 10, 2009. I was born in India and now I am settled in
    Canada. I have a dream of one day goign to MIT in Boston and getting my degree there. Both my parents are amazing
    and they are hard working and they are both over the age of 40. My parents are the best and even if they
    wanted they would lay down their lives just for the safety and comfort of me, their only child.</h2>

  <h2>My mom is an Oral Pathologist and is the kind that wants to retire at 50 years old and then help ut the world on
    becoming
    a better place. For a big chunk of my life I have only lived with my mom. We both used to live in Columbus,Ohio and
    then we
    both moved to where dad was studying in 2019 when I was 9 years old. I had only stayed with my mom from the age of 5
    to the
    age of 9.</h2>

  <h2>My dad Sunil Mutalik on the other hand is devoted his life's work to continue running the family. My dad was a
    really hard worker all of his life and he only wanted his family's life to be better. For that same reason mom and
    him had to split up because there was no radiology course in Columbus and there was no pathology in
    Hartford,Connecticut where my dad stayed. At the age of 9 though when mom finished studying and got a job in
    Winnipeg,Manitoba we were able to move to Connecticut and then mom came to Canada and then me and dad moved, we got
    a house and then we were all together happily ever after. </h2>
